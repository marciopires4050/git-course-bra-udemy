=====
Super late answer, but hopefully still helpful:

git config --global --unset-all user.name

Then you're free to:

git config --global --add user.name <whatever>
========


git config --global -e

This command will open GNU nano editor with what you are expecting.

Last but not least usefull, although it's a marginal case is to use

git config --global --remove-section user

In my case it cleared the data perfectly and with little to no effort
